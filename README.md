## Fri 7:00 PM Story

Hello! My name is Lana Janoff II. I am a galactic hacker. Do not
worry. I do ethical hacks. Usually, I am getting requests from planets
to do a penetration test. Most of the habitable planets in our galaxy
are surrounded by the network satellites to protect it from space
pirates. Satellites cover the planet with an invisible shield, so
nothing can go through the shield, but people need to travel, tourism
and trading. For authorized persons, the shield will open the window,
and a space ship can go. My job is to test the system and make sure
unauthorized people would not be able to land on the planet.

Communicator chime.

- Hello.
- Hello, is this Lana? I am representative of the planet Blabla. We
  need to do a penetration test of our new authentication system. We
  are offering you for this work 1.3 Billion Galactic Credits.

## Fri 19:30 PM Gameplay description

Fly in the space next to the planet, approach satellites and hack
them. As soon as certain present of satellites are hacked gate of the
shield will open.
